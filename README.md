PANDA WoW Name Generator

PANDA stands for Petoholics Anonymous Naming Development Application, which is really just a catchy acronym. In reality, it's a Flash file that pulls names from an XML file and randomly displays 10 of them. They are also categorized, which is accessed through a dropdown menu.

Due to a lack of interest and resources, I have discontinued PANDA on my website. But since it is quite popular, I'd like to make it freely available to the community so they can continue using and developing it, and it seems that GitHub is a good place to do that.

All of the source files should be uploaded here so knock yourselves out. :)

Note: The names.xml file will need to be hosted on the same domain as name_gen.swf. You will also need to update this URL within the Flash source to make the generator work.
